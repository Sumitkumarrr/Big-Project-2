        <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  The temple, which is dedicated to Lord Shiva, is said to be more than 1,200 years old.

                A visit to the Kedarnath temple is an integral part of the famous Char Dham Yatra in Uttarakhand.
                What is the history of Kedarnath?
                According to mythology, Pandavas built the Kedarnath temple after Mahabharata. It is said that Pandavas wanted to go to Lord Shiva for forgiveness after killing their Kaurav brothers to atone for their sins. But Lord Shiva did not want to meet them.
                 That's why Lord Shiva hid in Guptkashi.     </p>
